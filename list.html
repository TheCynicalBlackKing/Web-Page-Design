									<li> <u> Activities: </u> We have primarily dealt with accumulating funds throughout the year, whether it was through selling various items (novelties/candy), or organizing several events that were either made open to the community, younger students, or just high schoolers. Beyond that we have not done much else, although we have participated in a few competitions, with one group actually placing first in their competition. In regards to my own activities done for the club, I have mostly assisted in setting things up, and making sure that everything was ready for the various events and or competitions. </li> <!--Third Item In The List: Description Of Club Activities-->
