      <h1> Origin </h1>

              <p> The Transformers was a series created in the 1980's as a way to advertise Hasbro's Transformers toy line, which was created from altering Takara's Diaclone and Microchange lines through minor retools and or redocos. </p>

              <p> The toys that the Transformers were modified from were not intelligent robots, but instead remote control mechs that were used by human pilots, however, under the Transformers brand, every toy was a sentient robot, and so the story was written to accommodate this fact. </p>

              <p> Since the Transformers first aired, the FCC has enforced stricter regulations around children's programming; A program may not use on-screen talent or 'identifiable program characteristics' (or display website addresses) to advertise during or adjacent to the 'host' program, even if the website contains primarily non-commercial program-related material. While these regulations have not substantially affected toy-related shows, they have largely curtailed the practice of creating a toy-related show specifically to promote and market a toy. </p>
