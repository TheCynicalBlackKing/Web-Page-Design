	<h3> <u> Reflection: </u> </h3>
	
	<p> Everything that we went over today was just a review from Freshman year, since that was the first time I had taken Web Page Design, and so the only thing that I did not remember from then was how you would start a document whenever you are coding a web page. </p> <!--Reflection about yesterday's lesson-->
	
	<h3> <u> The Purpose Of Having Various Headers: </u> </h3> 
	
	<p> Different headings allow you to create variations amongst your webpage, specifically when titling various headings, since you would want the initial heading to be the largest, however, you would most likely not want the next header to be as large as the previous one, so being able to create smaller headings would be useful. It can also be used to show the hierarchy of the web page</p> <!--Why It Is Useful To Have Multiple Headings Of Various Sizes-->
