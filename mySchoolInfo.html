Beyond that we have not done much else, although we have participated in a few competitions, with one group actually placing first in their competition. In regards to my own activities done for the club, I have mostly assisted in setting things up, and making sure that everything was ready for the various events and or competitions. </li> <!--Third Item In The List: Description Of Club Activities-->

												<li> <u> Description: </u> A class that focuses on various pieces of literature that revolve around the topic of conformity vs. indivudulization and the American Dream. Some of the pieces that we read throughout the course included <i> Manhood In America </i> , <i> Catcher In The Rye </i>, <i> Death of a Salesman </i>, and <i> Hamlet </i>. There were a number of projects interspersed throughout the semester, which included writing a few short pieces analyzing a specific work (often a short story), a few projects, which included creating a video based on one of these pieces that we had read in class (music video or summary of the work), among others. The main focus throughout the semester was the I-Search, which was a significant portion of our grade, and involved us determining a topic, and conducting research on that topic utilizing a variety of sources (online, print, etc), along with performing our own research (survey, interview, experiment, etc). After conducting our research we would then write a 7 to 10 page paper addressing our topic, with a works cited and a works consulted. We were then required to hand in a binder with all of the components of our I-Search inside of it (rough draft, final draft, works cited and consulted, along with the research we conducted. We were then required to present this information utilizing visuals, with at least 7 minutes of speaking time, and up to 13 minutes for visuals (such as a video or audio clip). </li> <!--A Quick Overview Of The Class Material-->
												
												<li> <u> Evaluation: </u> I found the class to be very enjoyable, although if I could go back and do a few things over, I would spend a bit more time working on my I-Search speechh as well as conducting more research  since I did not really collect a considerable amount of useful information, and did not spend much time actually creating the speech and the visuals. </li> <!--Reflection On The Class-->

												<li> <u> Description: </u> A class that involved working with clay, and utilizing various techniques to create a number of different pieces with clay, and is primarily a hands-on experience.</li> <!--A Quick Overview Of The Class Material-->
												
												<li> <u> Evaluation: </u> I enjoyed bringing some of my ideas to life, and although they may not have all come out how I would have liked them to (primarily due to lack of experience), I still enjoyed coming up with these designs for the various projects. Some of my favorite projects was the slab and mold project, which I had made a lotus on a lily pad, but the one project that I am most proud of would be the cups that I made towards the end of the semester. Those cups are what I would consider to be my magnum opus, since they had turned out so well (for the most part at least), and was one of the two projects that I had the most difficulty with coming up with a final design. The one project that I was dissappointed with was the very final project that we had made, which was a box, mostly because I had to rush to finish the entire thing (even though I did not have to construct it in the first place because I was exempt from the final). If I had more time to work on the box, I would have taken my time with it, since I thoroughly enjoyed the concept I had for it, but due to a time-constraint, I had to rush the whole thing.</li> <!--Reflection On The Class-->

													<li> <u> Block: </u> 7 </li> <!--Period That I Had The Class-->
													
													<li> <u> Description: </u> A course that covered all of the material covered on the AP Statistics exam, and ran for only a semester instead of two (and so we it was weighted the same as an honors course instead of an AP). Despite being a math course, the kind of math that was done was mainlu Algebra I/Algebra II level. The course involved various statistical methods, such as those involved with sampling and experiments, the apporpiateness of a normal model, and various tests that were used when doing inference.  </li> <!--A Quick Overview Of The Class Material-->
													
													<li> <u> Evaluation: </u> Although the course may have taken up most of my free time, and had a fair impact on the quality of my I-Search presentation, the course itself was not difficult. Despite being primarily a math course, the material involved dealing with mostly theory and the application of various concepts, rather than algebraic equations. Overall I found it to be a fairly straight forward class, and would reccommend it to anyone who does better with abstract concepts and their application rather than algebra. </li> <!--Reflection On The Class-->

												<li> <u> Description: </u> An introductory course into computer science, and touches base with some of the key concepts of what makes a computer a computer, as well as covering a handful of computer programming languages along with their application. </li> <!--A Quick Overview Of The Class Material-->
												
												<li> <u> Preliminary Evaluation: </u> Due to my prior experience with programming (last semester), I have found that most of the material that has been covered throughout the semester has primarily been a review for me. Although I have learned how to code with Javascript and have done a considerable amount of work with it, code.org has frustrated me a bit since it does not merge the capabilities of "gamelab" and "applab" despite them both being JavaScript. I undertand that both of them deal with different applications of JavaScript, however, it annoys me that the API for Gamelab does not include some of the items in Applab, and vice versa. In regards to HTML and CSS, I find that the material that we have currently covered has mainly been a review and a refresher (specifically the ordered and unordered lists), and so taking an entire class period to explain what is essentially a singular aspect bores me. Overall, I have enjoyed coding, however, I find that the course moves at a fairly slow pace, and that irks me.</li> <!--Reflection On The Class-->

												<li> <u> Preliminary Evaluation: </u> Some of the movies we had watched during health were fairly interesting (Patch Adams in particular), and the quizzes that we have taken thus far on various sports as well as personal fitness have been fairly straightforward. I find no issue with the class, and in fact, it actually builds into my schedule my daily exercise, since I usually don't have much free time since it takes time for me to complete my schoolwork.</li> <!--Reflection On The Class-->

												<li> <u> Evaluation: </u> I found the course to be a bit underwhelming at times, since the professor had a teaching style similar to that of Mr. Wick (my English 11 CP teacher), and so his style of teaching was something that I had already been accustomed to. Much of the material that was covered throughout the marking period and a half was stuff that I had already known, and most of it lacked the specificity I had been hoping for when I had enrolled in the course. Although I had learned some new things while taking the course, it gave me an idea of the things that I will be encountering while earning my Master's Degree in Psychology over at Montclair State University. </li> <!--Reflection On The Class-->
